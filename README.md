# Fibonacci Siblings

Implemented the Fibonacci Siblings (at least, that's what I call it) in
Elixir, Ruby, and JavaScript

The below instructions run the included tests for each.
Each set of instructions assume that one is starting from the project root.

## In Elixir

```
   cd elixir
   elixir fib_siblings_test.exs
```

## In JavaScript

```
   cd javascript
   npm install
   npm test
```

## In Ruby

```
   cd ruby
   bundle
   rspec spec/fib_siblings-spec.rb
```
